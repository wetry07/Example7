## Project Overview

This application fetches user data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and displays it in a user-friendly list. Users can search for specific users by name, sort the list by name, and click on a user to view more details. The app also features loading and error handling and aims to be responsive on both mobile and desktop.

## Features

*   **User List Display:** Displays a list of users fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API, including name, email, and city.
*   **Search Functionality:** Allows users to filter the user list by name using a search bar.
*   **Sorting:** Allows users to sort the list of users alphabetically by name (A-Z or Z-A).
*   **User Detail Page:** Provides a detailed view of each user, including name, email, phone, company name, and website.
*   **Navigation:** Uses React Router for navigation between the home page and user detail pages.
*   **Loading and Error Handling:** Implements loading indicators and error messages when fetching data.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensures the UI is fully responsive for both mobile and desktop.
*   **State Management:** Uses React Context API to manage application state.
